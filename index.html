          <p>
            How does a designer know what words to display, how pages should be
            organized, or what pages should exist in the first place? These
            things aren't mysteries. They all come from a vision statement — a
            document that lays out the core scope and purpose of the site. this
            is a complete web developer visson.

          <h2>goals</h2>
          <p>
            The main objective when working as a developer is to be productive
            and deliver value to the company. As a developer or a CTO, the aim
            is to build practical applications that will be 100% successful. To
            achieve this, specific goals need to be set, which include:
            Enhancing your networking skills.

            This is not just an article of the sort but a fantastic resource on
            what it takes to become a Web developer. It lists all the
            technologies and tools a Web developer should be familiar with. I
            really liked those mind-maps which appear now in many other places
            on the web. It effectively complements The Web Developer Bootcamp
            course, which teaches you most of the technologies mentioned in this
            roadmap.

            Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep
            moving. People are like bicycles. They can keep their balance only
            as long as they keep moving. It is the same with people as it is
            with riding a bike. Only when moving can one comfortably maintain
            one’s balance.
